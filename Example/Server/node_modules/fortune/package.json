Fortune is a web framework for prototyping hypermedia APIs that implement the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification. It comes with a modular persistence layer, with adapters for [NeDB](//github.com/louischatriot/nedb) (built-in), [MongoDB](//github.com/daliwali/fortune-mongodb), [MySQL](//github.com/daliwali/fortune-relational), [Postgres](//github.com/daliwali/fortune-relational), & [SQLite](//github.com/daliwali/fortune-relational).\n\nGet it by installing from npm:\n```\n$ npm install fortune\n```\n\n### Road to 1.0\n\nThere is a release tag for `v1.0` of JSON API, though Fortune does not yet implement the entire feature set. What needs to be done:\n\n- Querying, pagination, sorting\n- Compound documents\n- Content negotiation between different formats (future, planned)\n- Ensuring specification compliance\n\nContributions welcome.\n\n### Features\n\nFortune implements everything you need to get started with JSON API, with a few extra features:\n\n- Batteries included, Fortune handles routing and database interactions so you don't have to.\n- Serializers and deserializers for JSON API, and other hypermedia formats (in the future).\n- Hooks to implement application specific logic before/after interacting with resources.\n\nIt does not come with any authentication or authorization, you should implement your own application-specific logic (see [keystore.js](//github.com/daliwali/fortune/blob/master/examples/keystore.js) for an example).\n\n## Guide & Documentation\n\nThe full guide and API documentation are located at [fortunejs.com](http://fortunejs.com/).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nHere is a minimal application:\n\n```javascript\nvar fortune = require('fortune');\nvar app = fortune();\n\napp.resource('person', {\n  name: String,\n  age: Number,\n  pets: ['pet'] // \"has many\" relationship to pets\n});\n\napp.resource('pet', {\n  name: String,\n  age: Number,\n  owner: 'person' // \"belongs to\" relationship to a person\n});\n\napp.listen(1337);\n```\n\nThis exposes a few routes for the `person` and `pet` resources, as defined by the JSON API specification:\n\n| HTTP   | Person             | Pet               | Notes                                                        |\n|--------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GET    | /people            | /pets             | Get a collection of resources, accepts query `?ids=1,2,3...` |\n| POST   | /people            | /pets             | Create a resource                                            |\n| GET    | /people/`:id`      | /pets/`:id`       | Get a specific resource, or multiple: `1,2,3`                |\n| PUT    | /people/`:id`      | /pets/`:id`       | Create or update a resource                                  |\n| PATCH  | /people/`:id`      | /pets/`:id`       | Patch a resource (see [RFC 6902](//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)) |\n| DELETE | /people/`:id`      | /pets/`:id`       | Delete a resource                                            |\n| GET    | /people/`:id`/pets | /pets/`:id`/owner | Get a related resource (one level deep)                      |\n\n### Unit Testing\n\nTests are written with Mocha, and are run against the built-in NeDB adapter, plus MongoDB & MySQL on Travis. You will also need to have the developer dependencies installed. To run tests:\n\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\n### Client-side Implementations\n- [Ember Data](//github.com/emberjs/data): the original implementation, it needs a [custom adapter](//github.com/daliwali/ember-json-api) to actually work.\n\n### Meta\n\nFor release history and roadmap, see [CHANGELOG.md](//github.com/daliwali/fortune/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nFortune is licensed under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.md](//github.com/daliwali/fortune/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
